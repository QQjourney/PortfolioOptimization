# Portfolio Optimization - Financial Engineering G13

This project focuses on portfolio optimization using modern financial techniques, incorporating tools such as Python, `yfinance`, and optimization algorithms. The goal is to construct an efficient portfolio that maximizes returns while minimizing risk.

## Project Overview

In this project, we implement a **Portfolio Optimization** model using historical stock price data. The key objectives include:
- **Data Collection:** Utilizing `yfinance` to fetch financial market data.
- **Optimization:** Applying mathematical optimization techniques from `scipy.optimize` to calculate the optimal asset allocation.
- **Visualization:** Plotting the efficient frontier and portfolio performance metrics using `matplotlib`.

## Features
- **Data fetching**: Automated downloading of stock price data using `yfinance`.
- **Risk-Return analysis**: Calculation of expected returns, volatility (risk), and covariance matrix of asset returns.
- **Efficient Frontier**: Construction of the efficient frontier, allowing investors to understand the trade-off between risk and return.
- **Optimization**: Using `scipy.optimize` to minimize portfolio risk for a given level of return or to maximize returns for a given level of risk.


## Methodology

1. **Data Retrieval**:
    - Download historical price data using `yfinance`.
    - Compute daily returns and construct the covariance matrix.

2. **Optimization**:
    - Use the Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization framework.
    - Optimize portfolio weights using the Sharpe ratio or based on minimum variance.

3. **Visualization**:
    - Plot the efficient frontier and highlight the optimized portfolio on the graph.

## Results

The final result is a portfolio allocation that offers the optimal balance of risk and return. The notebook generates visualizations of the efficient frontier and provides the optimized portfolio's key statistics, such as expected return and risk.
